# Groopme

*Groopme* is a social application for people to interested in visiting museums and attending events.

Many museums charge fees on entry and there are usually prices set for individuals and groups.
Groopme will allow a user to create an event with the **place**, **time** and **minimum number of people** needed to form a group to visit these museums.

This project was developed at HackX, hackathon for first year students by KCL Tech Society (Nov 2015)
